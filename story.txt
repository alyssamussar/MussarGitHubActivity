  Once upon a time there was a giraffe named Big Poppa. Big Poppa
lived in a community of many other animals, including chickens,
sea cucumbers, chipmunks, and penguins. No one understood how
how they all lived together despite their very different habitat
requirements, but that is not important. One day, a visitor arrived!
