  Once upon a time there was a giraffe named Big Poppa. Big Poppa
lived in a community of many other animals, including chickens,
sea cucumbers, chipmunks, and penguins. No one understood how
how they all lived together despite their very different habitat
requirements, but that is not important. One day, a visitor arrived!

The visitor was a tall man. Not only was he tall, but he is also big. 
Not big in a fat way, big in a buff way. His name was Thomas Anglehorn.
Thomas had made his fortune in the giraffe trade and now he was looking 
for his biggest score yet; the legendary Big Poppa. Thomas had been hunting
Big Poppa for many a moon, finally he had found him.

when he found him Big Poppa was not scared at all. Big Poppa and the rest of his
community had been preparing for this day. When Thomas Anglehorn came, they used there
power of community to fight him off. Anglehorn was no match to the 
chickens, sea cucumbers, chipmunks, and penguins. He was defeated, and 
never bothered the community again.
